Docker -

Docker Network : Each container connects to a private virtual network - Bridge
Each virtual network routes through a nat firewall on the host IP.
All containers on a virtual network can talk to each other without opening ports.
You can create your own virtual network. Attach container to multiple networks, skip virtual network to use host ip --net=host. Use different network drivers to get different abilities.

Docker DNS hostnames make it easy for docker to identify different containers. Bridge network doesn't have DNS resolution. thus you can create links(--link) between two container when you spin them up.



docker container top - process listing in a container
docker container stats  - performance statistics of all containers
docker container inspect - details of one container config.

docker container run -it - i=interactive; t=tty
docker container exec -it
docker container port <cont>

docker network ls - shows all networks created - bridge is default; host is a network which skips the docker network to attach directly to he host machine; none - removes eth0 and leaves localhost only.
docker network inspect bridge - all network details
docker network create - creates a network
docker network connect - attaches container to a new network dynamically
docker network disconnect - removes container from a network dynamically
